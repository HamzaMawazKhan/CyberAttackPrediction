# Cyber Attack Prediction and Analysis using AI


In the notebook, we will be loading a dataset containing details of Cyber Attacks. We will be predicting the attack category based on the attributes of the attack.

We will walk through the process of loading the data, visualizing the data, cleaning the data, feature engineering, and building various AI models. Finally, we'll compare the performance of each model to find the most effective one.

In this project we build and evaluate the following ML Models: ANN, Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN
