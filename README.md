# Cyber Attack Prediction and Analysis using AI


📈 In the notebook, we will be loading a dataset containing details of Cyber Attacks. 🕵️‍♂️ We will be predicting the attack category based on the attributes of the attack.

🔎 We will walk through the process of loading the data, visualizing the data, cleaning the data, feature engineering, and building various AI models. 🧠 Finally, we'll compare the performance of each model to find the most effective one.
